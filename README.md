# Gacha Bot

This is a Discord bot that integrates with the [GachaMon](https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker/wiki/GachaMon-Collectable-Card-Game) component of the ironMON tracker. The app is written in Node.js using a SQLite database. It supports the following commands:

* `/addmon <code>` adds a GachaMon to your collection using the shareable code string from the tracker.
* `/collection` allows other users to see your collection.
